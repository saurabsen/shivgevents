## Infrastructure Layer

#### Database provider

EF Core is used with [Npgsql](https://www.npgsql.org/efcore/index.html) for EF core since the database is 
postgres. There is good documentation on [EF Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/get-started/) on MS docs. 
Also good docs are available on this [alternate site](https://www.learnentityframeworkcore.com/).
